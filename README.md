# Wine Preferences
A case study done as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

I combined data from my own wine tasting journal with larger data sets from two wine magazines using SQL, spreadsheets, and R. My analysis highlighted the top recommended countries for me to expand my wine tastings to, factoring in geographic context, price, and my own personal preferences.
